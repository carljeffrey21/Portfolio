        <h3>I'm a <span>Software/Web Developer</span></h3>
        <p>
          As a passionate and dedicated software developer, I thrive on solving
          complex problems through code and technology. With a strong background
          in programming languages such as Python, JavaScript, and Java, I have
          developed applications that enhance user experiences and improve
          efficiency. My journey into software development began with a deep
          curiosity about how digital products function, leading me to pursue
          formal education and hands-on projects that sharpened my skills.
          Whether it's building web applications, developing APIs, or optimizing
          backend systems, I enjoy tackling challenges that require creative and
          analytical thinking.

          Beyond technical expertise, I believe that collaboration and
          continuous learning are key to success in this field. Working in team
          environments has allowed me to refine my communication skills,
          ensuring seamless coordination with designers, project managers, and
          fellow developers. I have experience working in Agile development
          settings, where adaptability and problem-solving are crucial.
          Additionally, I am always eager to explore emerging technologies such
          as artificial intelligence, cloud computing, and cybersecurity to stay
          ahead of industry trends and deliver innovative solutions. What truly
          drives me as a developer is the opportunity to create impactful
          software that enhances people's lives. I take pride in writing clean,
          maintainable code that contributes to scalable and efficient systems.
          Whether developing a user-friendly mobile app or automating a business
          process, I find satisfaction in knowing that my work has a real-world
          impact. Looking ahead, I am excited to continue growing as a
          developer, embracing new challenges, and contributing to projects that
          make a difference.
